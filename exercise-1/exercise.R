# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "San Ramon"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
hometown.name = "Meghana"

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
hometown.height = 6.5

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
hometown.puppies = 2

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 2500

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost <- puppy.price * 2

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000
too.expensive <- puppy.price > 1000

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1K.  Compute this
# value in R, not just assign!
max_puppies <- 1000/puppy.price
